    <h1>Welcome to the Koen Lab</h1>

<p1>Here in the Koen Lab we study Memory, Aging, and Cognition using electrophysiology (EEG/ERP), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging, and eye tracking. Using these tools, we look to investigate what neural processes give rise to memory and how memory changes with age.
